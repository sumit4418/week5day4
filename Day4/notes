         1.the Arrays is a set of values or items of differents Data types.WHich can be hold expreesed updated the items which are under one identifier. 
         2.Syntax : let identifier= [item1, item2, item3, .........itemn]
         3. To access the item of the identifier, we use the concept od index.,
         4. index is a unique digit ,which ranges from 0 to n-1.
        
         2.Syntax : let identifier= [item1, item2, item3, .........itemn]  
         like[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, .....n-1]

function(s):-
        --The functions is also one the Identifier concept
        -- Which hold the set of statements under one Block
        --That block can be accessible  where ever and whenever it is required.
        --We have write the defination of function.i.e ----Function Defination
        --But, to access the defination there should be a Call i.e nothing but ---Function Call
